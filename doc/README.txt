OpenWS-J
=============================================

The OpenWS library provides a growing set of tools to work with web services at 
a low level. These tools include classes for creating and reading SOAP messages, 
transport-independent clients for connecting to web services, and various 
transports for use with those clients.

OpenWS-J requires working JAXP 1.3 and DOM Level 3 compliant parsers,
and this library requires the use of Xerces and Xalan for historical reasons.
We recommend those libraries be endorsed using the endorsement override
mechanism in the JVM to ensure their use.

The use of JDK 1.6 or higher is required. Older Java versions are not
supported.

OpenWS-J is licensed under the Apache License, version 2.
